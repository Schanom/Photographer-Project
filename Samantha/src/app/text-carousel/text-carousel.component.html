        <p class="d-block m-auto w-50 p-4">As a professional in a certain field, it is everyone’s dream to be recognized and awarded for the exemplary work that they do. Since is it a dream or a goal, people work hard in order to achieve it. Thus, through hard work, determination and perseverance, quite a few people have been nominated to receive an award. With this comes the responsibility or obligation of preparing a speech when accepting the award if ever it is given to them. Much like how actors and actresses always delivers a speech when they receive an Oscar Award, professionals from varying fields do the same.</p>

The winning work encompasses formal portraiture, large format landscape and small, detailed still-life images of the ‘ex-votos’ (offerings of religious devotion) found at pilgrimage sites of Lourdes (France), Ballyvourney (Ireland) and Grabarka (Poland).
            The photographer mainly explores themes of environment, belonging and identity.  She recently completed an MA (Distinction) in Anthropology of Travel, Tourism and Pilgrimage and has been recognised by a number of photography prizes.</p>

        <p class="d-block m-auto w-50 p-4">A handwritten note neatly folded and hidden in the crevice of a rock, crosses etched onto stone, ribbon carefully wrapped around piles of twigs. These are all offerings of religious devotion, known as ‘Ex-Voto’ and found at Christian pilgrimage sites worldwide. Often placed anonymously and hidden from view, pilgrims leave ex-votos as expressions of hope and gratitude, creating a tangible narrative between faith, person and the landscape. Taken at the pilgrimage sites of Lourdes, France, Ballyvourney, Ireland, and Grabarka, Poland, the project images encompass formal portraiture, large format landscape and small, detailed still-life images of the objects and markers left behind. Shot on 5x4, large format film, the images evoke a distinct stillness and reflect the mysterious, timeless quality present at these sites of great spiritual contemplation. People and landscape merge as place, memory and history entwine.</p>
